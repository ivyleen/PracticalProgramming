 
1.A company pays its salespeople on a
commission basis. The salespeople each receive
$200 per week plus 9 percent of their gross sales
for that week. For example, a salesperson who
grosses $5000 in sales in a week receives $200
plus 9 percent of $5000, or a total of $650.
Write a program (using an array of counters)
that determines how many of the salespeople
earned salaries in each of the following ranges
(assume that each salesperson's salary is
truncated to an integer amount):
– $200$299
– $300$399
– $400$499
– $500$599
– $600$699
– $700$799
– $800$899
– $900$999
– $1000 and over

Made a class that works with default and parameterized
constructor. For the default there are provided setters.
Working with parameterized constructor there is no need
to do anything else but to give the correct values with
making the object. There is DEBUG mode which provides
every value of sallaries and counts printed on the console.
There is getter for counter array if needed to operate.
I used containers such as vector(for the grosses and
sallaries) and std::array (fixed size container for counters).
For smooth usage of the program I made a bool member
which contains the information if we started with eighter
constructors and how to proceed with correct calculations.

2. Write a program that simulates the rolling of
two dice. The program should use rand to roll
the first die and should use rand again to roll
the second die. The sum of the two values should
then be calculated. Your program should roll
the two dice 36,000 times. Use a one-dimensional
array to tally the numbers of times each possible
sum appears. Print the results in a tabular
format. Also, determine if the totals are
reasonable (i.e., there are six ways to roll a 7, so
approximately one-sixth of all the rolls should
be 7).

------------------------------------------------------
                Solution for ex2
------------------------------------------------------
Made a class which is self sustained: rolling the two
dice, counting the sums, find the ideal and real
probabilities of rolling the specific number of the die.
I'm using std::array as primary and only container.
There is DEBUG mode which provides all the the different
components and stages of the program for better understanding.
Static cast is nececcery for obtaining the right
percentage and to put it in the container: division of
an integer by another integer is also integer.

3. A small airline has just purchased a computer for
its new automated reservations system. You have
been asked to program the new system. You are to
write a program to assign seats on each flight of the
airline's only plane (capacity: 10 seats). Make
appropriate menu and messages.



4. One of the more interesting puzzlers for chess buffs
is the Knight's Tour problem. The question is this:
Can the chess piece called the knight move around
an empty chessboard and touch each of the 64
squares once and only once? Write a program to
solve the problem.



5.A palindrome is a string that is spelled the same
way forward and backward. Some examples of
palindromes are "radar," "able was i ere i saw
elba" and (if blanks are ignored) "a man a plan
a canal panama." Write a recursive function
testPalindrome that returns true if the string
stored in the array is a palindrome, and false
otherwise. The function should ignore spaces
and punctuation in the string.



6. Linear search



7. Insertion Sort
