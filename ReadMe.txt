Stages and goals of the project:

    1) Make a modules with common examples for modern C++.
    2) Make a valid debug system across all modules.
    3) Make a documentation for the modules's code.
    4) Make an OpenGL application which can be used to visualize 
    the modules with menu and design.
    5) Make a valid debug system for the OpenGL application.
    6) Make a documentation for the OpenGL's code.
    7) Make series of tests of the program.
